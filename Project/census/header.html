<p id="n"> The National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) was created in October 2005 by the Organic Law No. 09/2005 of 14/07/2005 as an independent institution to replace the former Department of Statistics in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN) and the National Bureau of Census. </p> 


<p id="z"> As the primary data producer, NISR produces mandatory statistics such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producers Price Index (PPI), External Trade figures, Population Statistics and other special purpose-statistics from surveys such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), Household Living Conditions Survey (Enquete Integrale sur les Condition de vie des m√©nages or EICV in French), Census and others. It also conducts specific joint surveys such as Agriculture Survey, Service Provision Assessment Survey in partnership with the relevant institutions. 
There is a Law No. 45/2013 of 16/06/2013 on the Organization of Statistical  Activities in Rwanda.
